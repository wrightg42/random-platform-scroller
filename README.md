Random Platform Scroller
========================

A randomly generated platforming scroller. In this game you aim to reach the exit door. It is fully equipped with a level selector, turrets, varied types of platforms and much more. It was made using the Smart mobile studio pascal variation (found here: http://smartmobilestudio.com/) so may not be able to be compiled in normal pascal. The code is compiled into HTML  and javascript code, and the compiled project can be found here: http://www.pp4s.co.uk/main/prog-rps-intro.html along with some info about the game!
